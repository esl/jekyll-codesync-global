title: " Exop on StreamData
"
abstract: "I'd like to tell a story how I was inspired by Andrea Leopardi's talk. Property-based testing is a mindset he gave at ElixirConfEU 2018 in Warsaw, Poland, and what is ExopData as the result of this inspiration.

The audience will find out what are Exop and StreamData with a brief description of these libraries. Next, I'm going to provide the idea behind ExopData, how it was started and evolved, which tricky moments we've faced during the implementation. And how ExopData can help you with data generating or property-based testing."
