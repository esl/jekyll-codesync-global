title: " What you needa know about Yoneda
"
abstract: "Profunctor optics are a neat and composable representation of bidirectional data accessors, such as lenses (a getter and a setter, for example onto a field of a record), and their dual, prisms. The profunctor representation exploits higher-order functions and higher-kinded type constructor classes. The relationship with the getter and setter functions is not at all obvious; it turns out to be a fairly direct application of the Yoneda Lemma, arguably the most important result in category theory. This talk will explain the Yoneda Lemma, with many concrete examples, including profunctor optics."
