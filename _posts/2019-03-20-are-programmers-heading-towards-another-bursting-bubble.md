title: " Are programmers heading towards another bursting bubble?
"
abstract: "Software continues to eat the world. Many industries, such as retail and publishing, have already been swallowed whole. Television and advertising are half digested, bioscience is in the crosshairs. From punch cards, to octal, to assembly language, to static languages, to dynamic languages... software has always been used to make itself irrelevant. Which software subdomains are about to be eaten?"
