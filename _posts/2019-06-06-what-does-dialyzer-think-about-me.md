title: " What does Dialyzer think about me?
"
abstract: "If you have been in the BEAM community for a while, you know that Dialyzer is a tool with fanatic lovers and haters. In the speaker's personal opinion, however, most of the haters actually like Dialyzer, but absolutely loathe how the tool is treating them. In this talk I will explain how Dialyzer works, with the goal to help you decipher its warnings (or their absence), make it run faster and increase your overall productivity while using it."
