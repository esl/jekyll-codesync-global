YOUR ERLANG GRAPH FIX
If you take the word graph out of graphic, all you have is 'ick'.

For even a savvy Erlanger, becoming proficient with our digraph libraries can be a mountainous trek. Mentally traversing data sets is arduous, especially when one keystroke slip can sink it all down a ravine. This talk's aim is to be a source of guidance that breaks the cycle. By the end, you'll be armed with methods & visualization techniques. The path up to the vertex of the mountain will be filled with fewer edges than you thought."
