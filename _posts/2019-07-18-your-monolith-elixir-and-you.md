title: " Your monolith, Elixir and you
"
abstract: "Elixir is great, so clearly we'll all rewrite our applications in Elixir.
Mostly, you can't and shouldn't do that.
This presentation will show you another path. Youâ€™ll see how at Liefery, Tobias and his team have started with small steps instead of rewriting everything. This allowed them to reap the benefits earlier and get comfortable before getting deeper into it."
