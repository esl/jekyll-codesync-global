title: " Do calculating machines like drawing? And if so, why? Considerations from media archaeology
"
abstract: "Of course, calculating machines do not like to draw. In fact, they will just not do it. I am a machine, they will say, a machine for calculations. That's exactly what I am supposed to do and that, therefore, I will do with utmost precision, reliable and correct. But there was a time when the calculating machine still had to be told what to do when its human master requested that a line was to be drawn, straight or circular. And many lines in many styles, and areas in brilliant colors. In such a way these visual object were supposed to appear an paper that galleries and museums, through their directors, would say, that's marvellous and rather surprising, and causing a lot of new thinking, but we exhibit that stuff anyway. And we don't hesitate too much and even call it art if it is nice enough."
