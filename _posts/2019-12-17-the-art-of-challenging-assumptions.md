title: " The art of challenging assumptions
"
abstract: "We spent countless hours and sleepless nights bringing and keeping up server-side of the most successful messaging service in the world. Looking back, how many choices we'd change? And how to ensure we make the right one next time? The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times; premature optimization is the root of all evil (Donald Knuth). But why does it happen? Why did we do something we didn't really want?
Because we acted on assumptions. 

This talk will guide through a number of war stories where assumptions were made and acted on. There were regrets and disappointments, and we learned to challenge assumptions in the hard way. Now it's time to share what we learnt so far."
