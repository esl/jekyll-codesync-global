title: " Eir: Infrastructure for working with BEAM code
"
abstract: "Eir is an intermediate representation for Erlang code. It is designed to support advanced code optimizations, and for use with LLVM.

During the presentation, two proof-of-concepts will be presented, both utilizing Eir:
• Whirl - A proof-of-concept WebAssembly runtime for BEAM languages
• Niffy - A tool for automatically generating NIFs from Erlang/Elixir code

The talk will serve as a walkthrough of Eir and it's related projects, including where it came from, where it is right now, and where it might be headed in the future."
