title: "Playing with Lambda Calculus"
abstract: "We all learn a lot about Turing Machines and why it is an important model and its correlation to the microprocessors we have today However, not everyone learn about another important model: Lambda Calculus. We'll learn a little bit about simple untyped lambda calculus, implement some data structures using only functions (no other Elixir data type) and hopefully have some fun."
