MICROSERVICES WITH ELIXIR
This walk will show the easiness of developing microservices with elixir with approaches to project structure, communication protocols, and libraries.

Umbrella apps allow code/configuration/state splitting and keep your apps isolated and independent.
Erlang Distribution Protocol allows you to invoke code in remote nodes without fuss.
Libraries like libcluster/swarm/partisan allow clustering and work stealing between the nodes
Using those mechanics, it allows us to use the good parts of monoliths and reduces the friction ongoing multi-node."
