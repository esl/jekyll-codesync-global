title: " Functional APIs with GraphQL & Elixir
"
abstract: "GraphQL is the next big thing in APIs development, and is slowly replacing RESTful based JSON APIs as a means of client-server communication. Elixir has excellent support for GraphQL in the form of Absinthe library. Hubert presents how to build and consume GraphQL from Elixir, but also how to think about GraphQL resources in a functional manner."
