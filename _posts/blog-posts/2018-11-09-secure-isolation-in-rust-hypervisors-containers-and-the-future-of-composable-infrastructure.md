title: " Secure isolation in Rust: hypervisors, containers, and the future of composable infrastructure
"
abstract: "Allison's first geek career was as a research linguist in eastern Africa, but her love of coding led her away from natural languages to artificial ones. In over 30 years as a developer, she has worked on everything from games, linguistic analysis tools, websites, and shipping fulfillment, to compilers, hypervisors, database replication systems, deployment automation, mobile apps, and talking smart-home appliances."
