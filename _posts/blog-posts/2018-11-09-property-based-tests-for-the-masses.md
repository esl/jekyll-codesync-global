title: Property based tests for the masses
abstract: Use property based tests to challenge your knowledge of the domain, to create smaller, fewer tests that: test more, are more readable & document the problem. Use them even (specially) in horrible eldritch codebases written in awful languages, use property based tests to ask questions to your codebase.
