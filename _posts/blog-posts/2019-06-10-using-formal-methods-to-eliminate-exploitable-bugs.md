title: Using formal methods to eliminate exploitable bugs
abstract: In this talk Kathleen explores the promise and limitations of current formal methods techniques for producing useful software that provably does not contain exploitable bugs.  She discusses these issues in the context of DARPAâ€™s HACMS program, which had as its goal the creation of high-assurance software for vehicles, including quad-copters, helicopters, and automobiles.
