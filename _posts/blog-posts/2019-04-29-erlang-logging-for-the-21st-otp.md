title: " Erlang logging for the 21st OTP
"
abstract: "In 2011, Andrew released lager and in 2012 he gave a talk at Erlang Factory SF explaining why he wrote it and comparing it to all the alternatives available at the time. A lot has changed since; most of the old competitors to lager have fallen out of usage, Elixir now exists and has its own logger and now, with OTP 21, Erlang finally has a new logger in the standard library. This talk will revisit the Erlang logging scene and compare all the modern alternatives."
