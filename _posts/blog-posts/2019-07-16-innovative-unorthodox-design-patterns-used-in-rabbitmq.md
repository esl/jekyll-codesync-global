"
abstract: "RabbitMQ messaging broker is over 10years old, with it's codebase having matured significantly over the past decade. Within it's implementation, we find some of the most innovative usage of the Erlang OTP which attribute to it's well trusted performance, stability and ergonomic friendliness for operators. In this talk, I illustrate, explain and share some of these creative internal design patterns used within RabbitMQ. Components such as mirrored-supervisors, decorators, gen_server2, delegates, and much much more!"
