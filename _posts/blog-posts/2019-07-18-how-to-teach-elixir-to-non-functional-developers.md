title: " How to teach Elixir to non-functional developers
"
abstract: "In this talk, Leandro presents efficient ways of teaching newcomers to a programming language: how to get people interested in the language, where people usually struggle and how to overcome these challenges. This will use Elixir as the basis language but will serve as a framework to generalise to other functional languages."
