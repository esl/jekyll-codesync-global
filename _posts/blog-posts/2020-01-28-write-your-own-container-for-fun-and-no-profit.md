title: " Write your own container, for fun and no profit!
"
abstract: "Docker has really popularized containers in the past few years! How does a docker work? Is it really a light-weight virtual machine? How does one isolate the processes and manage resources in a container? Can one write their own docker?

In this talk, we get familiar with the basic building blocks of Linux containers namely chroot, namespaces, and cgroups. We discover syscalls that we can use to manipulate namespace, how to apply resource limits and write our own container in Rust!"
