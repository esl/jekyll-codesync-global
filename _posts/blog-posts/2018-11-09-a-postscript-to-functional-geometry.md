title: " A PostScript to functional geometry
"
abstract: "Peter Henderson's 1982 Functional Geometry is a classic paper that shows the beauty and power of functional representation. Using functions to represent pictures, Henderson defines a small set of combinators to create a replica of Escher's recursive tessellation Square Limit. It's a nice kata for functional programmers. However, you could also implement Henderson's combinators in concatenative languages, which excel at composition! In this talk, I'll show you how. For choice of language, I turn to PostScript, a proven and battle-worn concatenative language that has been on the plateau of productivity for decades. It's also rather good for drawing. With one neat trick, values on the stack can be captured inside an executable array, to simulate closures. And the rest is easy."
