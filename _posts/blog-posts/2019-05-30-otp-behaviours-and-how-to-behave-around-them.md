title: " OTP behaviours and how to behave around them
"
abstract: "One of the first things every newcomer faces when they meet OTP are behaviours. The general explanation for them is usually along the lines of """"they're like interfaces for OOP"""". While that's somewhat accurate, it's also misleading and introduces a lot of confusion on how and when to use the existing behaviours and when it's reasonable to define your own ones. 

In this talk, Brujo will explain what behaviours are, how they should be used, and how to create and expose new ones if you ever need to."
