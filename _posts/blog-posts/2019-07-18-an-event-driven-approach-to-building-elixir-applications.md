title: " An event-driven approach to building Elixir applications
"
abstract: "We experience the real world by reacting to events that have occurred, what if we modelled our Elixir applications in the same way?

Event sourcing is an approach where application state changes are modelled as an immutable series of application-specific domain events over time. Changes made by end users of such applications are recorded as new events. Unlike in a traditional CRUD application, where updates and deletes are destructive operations, events are never deleted.

OBJECTIVES
Introduce the concept of event sourcing with a practical application in Elixir. Talk covers the how, why, and why not to apply an event-driven approach to building your Elixir applications and services.

AUDIENCE
Anyone interested in discovering how the simple concept of using domain events to capture state changes can bring tangible benefits to application development.
