title: Unsung Heroes of the BEAM
abstract: There are women –rarely known– who have had a massive impact in the Erlang & Elixir community. We wouldn’t even be here in this conference if it wasn’t for some of them. Their achievements and stories are known only in small circles because often their protagonists have been humble and discreet.
