title: Building a Billion Dollar Cryptocurrency with Haskell
abstract: This talk is an experience report on the development and operation of a top-10 open blockchain cryptocurrency written in Haskell.

Cardano is a recently released blockchain cryptocurrency system developed by IOHK and implemented primarily in Haskell. It has a number of innovative technologies and a long future roadmap, but in this talk Duncan will focus less on the 'what' and more on the question of 'how' and on transferable lessons:

   * How the system has been and is being developed;
   * How we balance rapid development with higher assurance development;
   * Playing to Haskell's strengths;
   * Opportunities for higher assurance with formal specifications;
   * Bridging the gap between research and products;
   * Building a larger Haskell development team and training;
   * What has gone well, and what has gone badly, and lessons we can learn.
