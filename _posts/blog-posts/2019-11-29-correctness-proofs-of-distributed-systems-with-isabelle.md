title: " Correctness proofs of distributed systems with Isabelle
"
abstract: "Testing systems is great, but tests can only explore a finite set of inputs and behaviours, while many distributed systems have an infinite state space. If you want to be sure that a program does the right thing in all possible situations, testing is not sufficient: only mathematical proof can cover an infinite state space. This talk introduces Isabelle/HOL, an interactive proof assistant (a kind of programming language and REPL for proofs), and explores how to formally verify distributed algorithms."
