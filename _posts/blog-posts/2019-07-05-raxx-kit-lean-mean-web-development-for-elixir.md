title: Raxx.Kit - Lean mean web development for Elixir
abstract: "The Raxx ecosystem is a powerful, focused and extensible toolkit for web development. By providing tools focused just on the web layer, it is flexible enough to be used in any kind of application. Raxx.Kit boosts getting started with Raxx. It does this by introducing conventions for project structure, asset management, deployment, testing and more. Now Raxx has reached 1.0, development is focused on bolstering and expanding the conventions in Raxx.Kit that are most useful to developers."
