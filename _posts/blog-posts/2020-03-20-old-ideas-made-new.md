title: Old ideas made new
abstract: "Languages and ecosystems are more than simply syntax; they're ways of thinking. They have features, idioms, and community standards that drive us towards certain ways of doing things. Erlang is over 30 years old and has a very mature way of doing things. Elixir came on the scene, bringing with it some new ideas from other ecosystems. We're seeing even more of this with BEAM languages from LFE to Alpaca to Erlog."
