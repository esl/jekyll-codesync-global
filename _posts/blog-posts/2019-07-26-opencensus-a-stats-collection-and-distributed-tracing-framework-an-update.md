title: " Opencensus: A stats collection and distributed tracing framework - an update
"
abstract: "In microservices architectures, it is difficult to understand how services use resources across shared infrastructure. In monolithic systems, we depend on traditional tools that report per-process resource usage and latency characteristics that are limited to a single process. In order to be able to collect and analyze resource utilization and performance characteristics of distributed systems, OpenCensus tracks resource utilization through the chain of services processing a user request."
