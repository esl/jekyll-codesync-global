title: " The Alchemist's Code: Bringing More Value with Less Magic
"
abstract: "Every developer has faced this at least once. You return to the code you wrote some time ago and you have no idea what it does. This can be frustrating, especially if said code has just crashed in production. But there is a way of designing applications so they are approachable, even upon first reading. The approach Rafal presents can make software more valuable to customers, allowing for quick response to change. It also benefits other developers, who can easily intuit how to put new features in place."
