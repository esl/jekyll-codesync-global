title: BEAM for smart energy
abstract: This talk presents a case study applying Erlang in the energy domain.  Within STORY - a Horizon 2020 project - industrial automation and Erlang have been targeting energy storage installations. In industrial automation, an IT platform disruption is long overdue, and the pressure is rising continuously. When the disruption happens, Erlang, Elixir, the OTP, BEAM and ERTS represent unrivalled value. In STORY, embedded and networked digital twins - implemented in Erlang - demonstrate this.
