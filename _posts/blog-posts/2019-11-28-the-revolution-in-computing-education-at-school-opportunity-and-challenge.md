title: The revolution in computing education at school: opportunity and challenge
abstract: In this talk, Simon explains what’s going on, especially the recent launch of the National Centre of Computing Education. This revolution is taking place in our core expertise, in within yards of our front doors. And we are being invited to contribute to it, and shape how it “lands”. What an opportunity! Let’s grab it; Simon will make concrete suggestions about how.
