title: " Think in Erlang!
"
abstract: "Have you ever felt that a solution is too complicated?

In this talk, you are going to learn a universal recipe that you can use every day to provide simple solutions to complex problems. We start with the philosophy of Erlang and learn its key messages. Then we study how these core thoughts are baked into Erlang/OTP, and why they help. Then we are going to see how Cisco NSO engineers created a patented algorithm to solve a complex problem: orchestrating network services. Yes, using the same recipe!"
