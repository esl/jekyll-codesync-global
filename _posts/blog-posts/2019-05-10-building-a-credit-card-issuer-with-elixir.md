title: Building a credit card issuer with Elixir
abstract: "In this talk we're going to navigate through the challenges and issues we faced when we started building Brex and,how we chose to live in a world of microservices with Elixir. We will go over how we build systems on Brex, why we don't use OTP for clustering and where we think it's the correct place to use it."
