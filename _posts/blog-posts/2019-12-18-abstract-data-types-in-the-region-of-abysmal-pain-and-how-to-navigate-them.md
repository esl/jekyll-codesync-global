title: Abstract data types in the region of abysmal pain, and how to navigate them
abstract: "Abstract data types are an essential tool in a programmer's toolkit, but finding a data structure to fit them can be challenging. This is especially so for graphs, which can have complex constraints that are difficult to encode using conventional data structures. Join me in the search for a functional, typesafe graph. We will explore different graph representations, and discover how types can help us encode constraints. Using dependent types, we will construct a graph that we can prove satisfies its abstract data type."
