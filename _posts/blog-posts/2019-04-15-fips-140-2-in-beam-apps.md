title: " FIPS 140-2 in BEAM apps
"
abstract: "Erlang's crypto module has supported a FIPS mode since release 20.0. Drew will discuss why you may care about FIPS 140-2 encryption, ways to integrate it into your tests suites and gotchas to compliance. He will discuss how simply putting crypto in FIPS mode is not enough. Learn how dependencies and built-in libraries can sneak non-FIPS crypto into your application. Drew will also cover some general techniques to detect security issues in your code."
