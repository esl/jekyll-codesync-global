title: " GeoRacer: Building a real-time multiplayer mobile game in Elixir in 6 weeks.
"
abstract: "Phoenix Phrenzy was an app building competition to show off a brand-new feature in the Phoenix web framework called LiveView. LiveView allows developers to build dynamic, real-time web interfaces using only Elixir. Our team wanted to push the boundaries of LiveView, so we built a geo-location based racing game we called GeoRacer and were delighted when our app won. In this session, we'll share the story of building GeoRacer and show how LiveView can give you web app building super powers."
