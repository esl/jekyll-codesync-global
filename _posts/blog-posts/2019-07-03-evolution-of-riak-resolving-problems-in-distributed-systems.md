title: " Evolution of Riak: resolving problems in distributed systems
"
abstract: "This talk will cover some problems of building a distributed system framework:

- Mass adoption of scale-out with difficult developer trade-offs is hard to achieve;
- The problems of testing claims of correctness;
- Replication of activity and the impact on throughput, and replication of data can itself be a cause of data loss;
- Non-conformity of performance between nodes is very difficult to manage (one slow node)."
