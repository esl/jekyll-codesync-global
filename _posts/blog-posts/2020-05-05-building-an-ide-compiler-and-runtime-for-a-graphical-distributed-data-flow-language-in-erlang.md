title: Building an IDE, compiler and runtime for a graphical distributed data flow language in Erlang
abstract: Control systems have their own programming languages and paradigms. Progammable Logo Controllers (PLCs) are used to control everything from a garage door opener to a whole factory. We have built a compiler for a distributed variant of PLC programming language (IEC 61499) that compiles to BEAM files which run in Erlang VMs. As a web frontend to an Erlang node we built an IDE for the textual and graphical representation. PLC programme run distributed from small embedded systems to the cloud unchanged.
