title: " Can you teach a school class functional programming?
"
abstract: "When discovering SWI Prolog at age 14, an entirely new world was opening up in front of me. All of a sudden I could create whatever I wanted, and it was with that experience that I took on the challenge my colleague was throwing at me that Monday morning: Can you teach a school class functional programming?"
