title: Typeclasses: the value of programming vocabulary
abstract: "Monoids, Applicatives, Monads and Semigroups. What are these things?
Much more importantly, however, why should one care?
Elixir programmers are blessed with a language that allows them to be productive, seemingly without needing to reach for these arcane spells. And yet, for building architectures we have spells like "GenServer" and "Supervisor", among others.
Maybe we can find useful tools in the ivory tower of Haskell?
