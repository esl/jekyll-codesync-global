title: Digging through the garbage
abstract: The BEAM was designed to run on 1980's hardware and never crash. How does it manage to run for so long on machines with such little memory and still have such good soft-real time performance? This talk explores the answer by looking at the basics of how the BEAM handles memory in processes and a bit about its very special garbage collection algorithm.
