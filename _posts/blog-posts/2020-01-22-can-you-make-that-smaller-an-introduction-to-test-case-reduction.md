title: Can you make that smaller? An introduction to test-case reduction
abstract: "Debugging is the other hard part of programming, and it's made much harder when your only means of reproducing the bug is large and complicated. Often the easiest way to get to the bottom of the problem is to take your large, complicated, example and gradually replace it with a smaller, simpler, one that more clearly demonstrates the problem. That's called test-case reduction, and it's pretty boring to do by hand, so we have automatic tools called test-case reducers to do it for us."
