title: Continuous tracing in production (without Erlang's trace module)
abstract: Collecting trace data from your application is a very important, but often overlooked,  aspect of Application Performance Monitoring (APM). In this talk, we will learn about the core concepts of application tracing (OpenTracing and OpenCensus), some of the tools that are available for collecting and visualizing trace data, and how this data can be used for troubleshooting errors and performance issues, in both monolithic and distributed micro-service architectures.
