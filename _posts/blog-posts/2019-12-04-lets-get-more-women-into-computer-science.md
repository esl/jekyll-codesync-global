title: Let's get more women into computer science
abstract: "It is well known that science and engineering disciplines fail to attract and retain women, in academia and in industry. And horrifyingly, computer science is at the bottom of the class. In this talk, Mary will consider the current sorry state of computer science in academia, why we have ended up here, and what we can do."
