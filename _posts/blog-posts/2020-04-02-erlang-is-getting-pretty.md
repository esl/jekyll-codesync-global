title: Erlang is getting pretty!
abstract: How much time did you spend today reading code? How many times did you have to look harder because of how the code looked?

Maintaining a clear and consistent code style is hard: manual inspections often leads to endless bikeshedding and linters add noticeable overhead to the workflow. Many languages solved this issue through automated code formatters - Go, Rust, Elixir, Elm among many others. And now, thanks to the new erlfmt tool, Erlang is getting pretty as well!

Come to this session to learn more about erlfmt - how it works and how it can help your team.
