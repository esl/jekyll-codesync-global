title: Tortoise evolved: MQTT 5 support in the Tortoise MQTT client
abstract: MQTT is a light-weight PubSub protocol used for machine to machine communication. It its often used in IoT applications, so it fits well in many Nerves projects. Tortoise is a MQTT client for Elixir. It started its life as a MQTT 3.1.1 client, but is in the progress of getting an upgrade to the latest version of MQTT; version 5. Martin will introduce MQTT; give an overview of the new features in MQTT 5; how Tortoise is designed to make MQTT easy to work with in Elixir, and how MQTT 5 will influence that design.
