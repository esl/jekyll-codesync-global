title: The BEAM programming paradigm
abstract: "BEAM language systems have a different set of paradigms from other programming language systems, emphasizing on the immutability of the language elements and the robust protection against the possible malfunction. We demonstrate what kind of principles the BEAM language systems focus on by comparing with the examples of other language systems and the applications including C++ and C#."
