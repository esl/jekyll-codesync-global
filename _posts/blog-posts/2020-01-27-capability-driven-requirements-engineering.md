title: Capability Driven Requirements Engineering
abstract: "In this talk I would like to share findings and application of capability driven approach designed to enable informative system transformations.

When planning for changes and improvements â€“ and scale in particular -- we need to consider not only code to be updated but the whole ecosystem: people, code, resources. The capability-driven approach is a systematic, analytical, and traceable approach to requirements engineering. The approach was validated in a number of industrial-size application, and is not limited to a particular area."
