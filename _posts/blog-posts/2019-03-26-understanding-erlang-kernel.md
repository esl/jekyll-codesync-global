title: Understanding Erlang kernel
abstract: The Kernel application has all the code necessary to run the Erlang runtime system. Every application needs to include kernel application to be able to run. When starting an Erlang shell there are 39 processes running inside BEAM. What are those 39 processes and how do them work together to make BEAM tick? What exactly does Erlang kernel do and why does every application need it? What happened inside BEAM when you print a simple hello world to the screen? In this talk we will take a deep dive into Erlang's kernel and find out how beautiful Erlang's internal works.
