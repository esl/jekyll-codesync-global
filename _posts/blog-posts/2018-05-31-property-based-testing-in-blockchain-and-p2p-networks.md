title: " Property-Based Testing in Blockchain and P2P Networks
"
abstract: "Testing is a major part of all software development - yet no matter how much effort is spent on it, some errors always seem to slip through. Cases which no-one thought to test crash systems late in development or out in the field, revealing errors which cost time and money to analyze, diagnose, and fix. In the worst case, such errors reveal fundamental flaws which force a redesign of part of the system, at disproportionate cost."
