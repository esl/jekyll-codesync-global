title: " Operable Erlang and Elixir
"
abstract: "Any system that is successful necessarily grows more complex. This means that code gets messier, but also that the people who are part of the system have to handle ever-increasing complexity. It is not sufficient to take a code-centric approach; to make our Erlang and Elixir systems truly operator-friendly, we have to understand how our mental models work, and what constitutes good automation. Finally, we need to be aware of all the tools the Erlang VM makes available to us to truly deal with the unexpected."
