title: " Working with legacy code
"
abstract: "In a world driven by software, sooner or later, everyone needs to develop code left behind by somebody else. In this talk, we discuss what is legacy code, how to understand it, and the required mindset needed to tackle it. Since dealing with legacy is mostly about understanding the code, we provide some ideas of what tools to use on the BEAM platform to ease grokking the legacy system. Through battle stories, we provide examples which challenge the job of future developers, suggesting how to avoid them."
