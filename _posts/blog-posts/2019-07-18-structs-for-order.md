title: Structs for order
abstract: "Sometimes when Andrey looks at Elixir code written by Elixir-newcomers he notices that some of them avoid Structs. Maybe ‘avoid’ is the wrong word, but he sees a lack of Structs usage. In most cases that usage ends up with Ecto models, but there are a lot of places in a Phoenix application (or just an Elixir console application) where Structs might be very helpful. During the talk Andrey will try to show the value of Structs and how they are related to an application's domain model as elementary entities that define data contracts and are responsible for this data validation and handling."
