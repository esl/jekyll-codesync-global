title: Programmation en Logique
abstract: "Prolog is one of the most underrated programming languages around; possibly because of its strange syntax and the unusual paradigm. But it is a very nice special-purpose programming language. In this talk, I would like to introduce Prologâ€™s programming model, showcase some programming domains in which Prolog allows for very concise, elegant programs, and finally describe how it can also be used as a general-purpose tool."
