title: What is a computer program? Historical and philosophical reflections
abstract: "What is a computer program? This seemingly simple question, which lies at the heart of computer science, has no simple answer today, neither in academia nor in industry. The responses one gives to it affect very real problems which concern not just the so-called (everyday) User but anyone (scientists, programmers, children, politicians, managers, artists, mathematicians, etc) who relies on computing for some reason. Some examples are:  Who is responsible if a given piece of software fails? and Should we apply patent or copyright law or neither to software?
