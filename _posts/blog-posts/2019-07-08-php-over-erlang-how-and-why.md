title: " PHP over Erlang: how and why?
"
abstract: "I started to develop this crazy idea back in 2013 when I was playing with PEG and Neotoma to parse another crazy idea to build a MySQL server simulator to access to Erlang and gather information (myproto). After the first try, I realize I can perform something with PHP could be impossible to do, like better resources control, real-time coverage or even use websockets. In 2016 Bragful project was created."
