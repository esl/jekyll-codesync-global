title: Diffing Hex packages
abstract: "The tech industry is extremely dependent on open source packages. But every dependency you rely on is also a vulnerability. Multiple high profile packages across platforms have been hijacked and modified with malicious code. This talk is about the value of auditing dependency updates and the tooling to make it less of a chore, including the introduction of a web-based diffing app and other tooling that helps you create an effortless auditing process."
