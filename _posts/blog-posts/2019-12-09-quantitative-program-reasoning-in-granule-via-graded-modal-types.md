title: Quantitative program reasoning in Granule via graded modal types
abstract: "A benefit of static typing is that various program properties can be specified and automatically checked as part of a language. But there are always limits to what can be expressed.

This talk presents Granule, a functional language which pushes these limits by combining linear and indexed types with the recent notion of graded modal types. Dominic will share examples enforcing privacy constraints, stateful protocols, and verifying properties of standard functional programs just by getting the right type signature."
