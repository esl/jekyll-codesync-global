title: Just delete it!
abstract: Are we creating big balls of mud within our applications? Is an abstraction necessary or is it going to couple the code to the implementation? Can I achieve code isolation without overcomplicating? The challenge is to reach the nirvana of simple code isolation verse complex code abstraction. But is it realistically obtainable? The challenge is set: implement patterns that will allow us to just delete & rewrite code in days instead of weeks, weeks instead of months, and months instead of ... version 2.
