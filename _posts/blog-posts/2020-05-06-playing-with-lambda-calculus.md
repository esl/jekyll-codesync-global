title: Playing with Lambda Calculus
abstract: We all learn a lot about Turing Machines and why it is an important model and its correlation to the microprocessors we have today. However, not everyone learn about another important model: Lambda Calculus. We'll learn a little bit about simple untyped lambda calculus, implement some data structures using only functions (no other Elixir data type) and hopefully have some fun.
