title: " Inch: How Elixir 1.7 changed the rules for documentation analysis
"
abstract: "In most languages there are tools for testing and static analysis to identify code smells and refactoring opportunities. But for a long time there was no tool to help you figure out which parts of a codebase were lacking documentation the most. This talk covers how Inch filled that niche for hundreds of Elixir programmers, what’s unique about Elixir’s approach to docs as first class citizens and how the recent support for EEP 48 in Elixir 1.7 changed the rules for documentation analysis."
