title: ErlangRT, a BEAM VM reimplementation in Rust
abstract: The time is long overdue to rewrite the technology, which we all use, in a safe and strongly typed language, such as Rust. Started with a small mailing list discussion in September 2017, the implementation is marching towards having a working Erlang shell and running Common Test suites from Erlang OTP source.
