title: Levelling up at Bleacher Report: A cautionary tale
abstract: "Elixir helped Bleacher Report grow from a scrappy startup to a household name. We saw gains just by introducing this new tool but to go further we need to learn how to master it. For self-taught programmers like myself that has meant learning some basic computer science. I will show how I applied data structures to get more out of Elixir. I'll also talk about some of the traps we left for ourselves as we were learning - and the horror of my experience breaking an app used by 3.7 million people."
