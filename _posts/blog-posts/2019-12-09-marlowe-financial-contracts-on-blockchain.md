title: Marlowe: financial contracts on Blockchain
abstract: "Marlowe is a high-level, domain-specific language (DSL) for writing financial contracts on blockchain. Marlowe is defined by an executable semantics in Haskell, and has been implemented on the UTxO-based Cardano blockchain. 
 
This talk will introduce Marlowe and describe its semantics, implementation and tooling as well as give examples, including some from the ACTUS financial standard. It will also address Marlowe as a Haskell DSL, and describe the choices made in designing and revising the language."
