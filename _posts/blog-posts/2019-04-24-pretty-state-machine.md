title: " Pretty state machine
"
abstract: "In this talk, I hope to pull back the curtain on `gen_statem` and provide a useful reference for how and when to use it and why the apparent complexity might be worth it.  What are its strengths and weaknesses?  Is there anything `gen_statem` can do that `GenServer` canâ€™t?  In this talk, I plan to explore these questions while providing some guidance and clarity on this mysterious behaviour available since the release of OTP 19."
