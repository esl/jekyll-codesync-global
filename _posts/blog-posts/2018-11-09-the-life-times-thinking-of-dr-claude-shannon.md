title: The life, times & thinking of Dr. Claude Shannon
abstract: The talk focuses on the life, times, and thought of Claude Shannon, the famed founder of the information theory. Claude Shannon is one of the foremost intellects of the twentieth century and the architect of the Information Age, whose insights stand behind every computer built, email sent, video streamed, and webpage loaded. He was a groundbreaking polymath, a brilliant tinkerer, and a digital pioneer. He constructed the first wearable computer, outfoxed Vegas casinos, and built juggling robots. He also wrote the seminal text of the digital revolution, which has been called “the Magna Carta of the Information Age.”
