title: " Life of a distributed graph database query
"
abstract: "Graph databases require a different approach to query language design. This is a complex problem in itself. On top of that, we would like to support querying a distributed graph database. This talk describes the life of a query in Memgraph. Follow the process from reading a query as a character string, through planning query operations for distributed execution and finally to the execution itself."
