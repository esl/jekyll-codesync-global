title: " Osa Gaius - Resisting Object-Oriented Programming | Code Elixir LDN 19
"
abstract: "This talk argues that the social costs of functional programming are due to that fact that object-oriented programming maintains hegemony. It charts the rise of object-oriented programmingâ€™s hegemony. It then examines instances of hegemonic power, most notably in technical interviews and accepted design patterns. Lastly, this talk offers code translation as one strategy for counter-hegemonic resistance."
