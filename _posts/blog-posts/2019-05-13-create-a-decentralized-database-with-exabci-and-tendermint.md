title: " Create a decentralized database with ExAbci and Tendermint
"
abstract: "Tendermint is a consensus engine that helps engineers to build various blockchain. It proposed an interface called ABCI (Application BlockChain Interface). ExAbci implemented the interface for elixir. This talk will focus on how to use ExAbci to build a decentralized database on top of it, making the database can survive all kinds of failure of 1/3 of nodes."
