title: " Finite of sense and infinite of thought: a history of computation, logic and algebra
"
abstract: "The talk will cover the long history of computation, logic and algebra, and the relationship between the three, from Classical times to the 20th century, starting out as a single discipline and then growing apart in the early 20th century. Rather than being surprising, this relationship stems from a single — yet fascinating — line of inquiry into the essence of thought, guided by a particular ancient aesthetic. We will focus on the importance of language and meaning in that evolution, and discuss the philosophical revolution that broke away from the linguistic tradition and completely changed how we view thought, computation and meaning."
