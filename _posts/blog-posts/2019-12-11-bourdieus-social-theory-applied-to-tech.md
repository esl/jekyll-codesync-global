title: " Bourdieu's social theory applied to tech
"
abstract: "Obscure though it may seems, the sociologist Bourdieu and his social theory tell us a lot about what is happening in the workplace and society around us. By understanding what he meant by "symbolic violence", "cultural capital" "hexis" etc, we see how each of us influences and is influenced by the people around us, in ways that we wouldn't expect.  From this talk, a vulgarized and easy to understand version of  Bourdieu's ideas, each of us can seek how to improve the ambience immediately around us
