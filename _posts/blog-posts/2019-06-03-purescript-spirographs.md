title: " PureScript spirographs
"
abstract: "Back when you couldn't make a phone call and be online at the same time, Tom was obsessed with spirographs. Small, composable gears are composed to form beautiful complex structures; sounds familiar, doesn't it? In this talk, we'll explore PureScript, get a computer to draw some spirographs, and see how functional programming makes the code almost as pretty as the end result."
