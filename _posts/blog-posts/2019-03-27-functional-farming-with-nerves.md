title: " Functional farming with Nerves
"
abstract: "How FarmBot rewrote it's embedded firmware in Elixir with Nerves in under a year. Connor will show how a weekend prototype was faster to develop, more stable and easier to deploy than the existing firmware. He will also show the integration of NervesHub to maintain the fleet of deployed devices."
