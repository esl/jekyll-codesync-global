"
abstract: "If you want to be a great Elixir developers, you need to learn to build your programs in layers, the way the experts do. In this session, we will explore the advice:

Do fun things with big, loud worker bees.

This sentence, from the bestselling Elixir book Designing Elixir Systems with OTP, is a mental mnemonic that stands for Data, Functions, Tests; Boundaries, Lifecycles and Workers. We'll talk about each of these layers in detail focusing on the role of each independent layer in a self-healing, performant Elixir program"
