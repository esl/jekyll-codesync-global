title: " Instrumenting and monitoring stateless Erlang today
"
abstract: "The tools we use to monitor and instrument Erlang deployments have changed rapidly. One of the difficulties many developers and managers have shared is a lack of good monitoring and instrumentation for Erlang. In this talk, I will talk about a journey towards a standardized stack of tools for monitoring and instrumentation for stateless Erlang deployments. Are you facing questions about whether your DB, application logic or networking is creating latency? Are you wondering how many requests you getting and which requests take the longest?"
