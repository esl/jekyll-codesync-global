title: " Do fish have legs: language design for the commercial coder
"
abstract: "As backend developers, we often need to expose functionality to front-end UIs. Frontend developers demand that APIs are simple and extensible, leading to either constant upkeep or unsound, complex code.

We will walk through a case study of creating an API in Scala for searches through the use of a DSL (Domain Specific Language). By taking inspiration from Lisp, language design and type systems, we will implement an API which will be secure, simple and extensible."
