title: " Towards specifications of robustness - the things that programs do _not_ do
"
abstract: "Programs are considered to be robust, if they behave “well” in all possible usage scenarios, whether intended or not. To help develop robust programs several programming language features and programming patterns have been proposed: constants, private members, encapsulation, capabilities, ownership, proxies, membranes etc. All these are powerful mechanisms which support the development of robust code."
