title: " Make a distributed toolbox with Ra
"
abstract: "Ra (https://github.com/rabbitmq/ra) is an implementation of the Raft consensus protocol by Team RabbitMQ. In RabbitMQ Ra is used to implement a consistent replicated queue but that isn't all that Ra can be used for. This talks will be a practical session on how to implement consistent distributed system essentials such as replicated a key-value stores, leader election processes, lock servers and other coordination services on top of the Ra library."
