title: " Erlang Distribution via UDP combined with Ethernet TSN
"
abstract: "After some initial experiments we now are looking at using UDP for Erlang Distribution. Ethernet TSN (=Time Sensitive Networking) is a set of new standards that extends Ethernet by controlling latency and redundancy on Layer-2 making it possible to implement hard realtime reliable datagram service."
