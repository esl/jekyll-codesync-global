<p>Igor began his work with Erlang as a part of his Master&#39;s thesis with Prof. Peter Van Roy in 2017. He has been working within the LightKone.eu project to develop a framework for reliable storage and computing on clusters of bare-metal Erlang GRiSP clusters.<br />
<br />
He has ported the Lasp programming library on GRiSP in order to enable reliable and convergent task execution on unreliable infrastructure-less edge networks. His current work is focused on further improving the current prototype of his model in order to validate it in actual production systems.</p>
