<p>James has been working in software for twelve years, primarily as a back-end web developer, most recently in the live music and online education sectors. He&nbsp;created the open-source web messaging system Faye, whose internals now form the&nbsp;basis of much WebSocket tooling in the Ruby and JavaScript ecosystems. James also enjoys hacking on language tools, creating the cross-language parser generator Canopy, and a toy logic&nbsp; programming language called Infer.<br />
<br />
James is the author of the book JavaScript Testing Recipes, and am working on a second called Building Git, available in 2019.</p>
