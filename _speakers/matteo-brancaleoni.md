<p>It was my father&#39;s fault. When in 1989 he bought me a Commodore 64, but I did not had any video games. So I learned programming and never stopped doing it. Working as a software engineer since 18 years, specialized in the telco industry. I really like being a developer because is possible to build things that yesterday were not deemed possible.</p>
