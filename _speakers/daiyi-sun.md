<p>Daiyi is a Californian alpine witch and software developer at Honeycomb who finds the world distressingly interesting. Daiyi likes explaining technical topics with drawings and gesticulations, meticulously architecting, instrumenting, and documenting her own life (and also code) through spreadsheets, sketchnotes, comic journals, plaintext files and accidentally volunteering for too many things in gentle open source communities.</p>
