Andrea ended up as a Software Developer, she is pretty sure there was no other viable option. 

Her current technical interests are F#, games, programming languages and philosophy of computing. She really enjoys finding different ways to write code, sometimes for performance, other times for succinctness, sometimes, just because she can, there is no better way to learn than trying. 

When Andrea is not working she tends to play with Haskell or other languages or cats. Conferences and meetups are a great way to learn more, so she tries to help when she can to make them happen. For that reason, Andrea co-organises Functional Kats and GameCraft. She also speaks at local and international conferences like Code Mesh LDN, Progressive.Net, ProF#, Lambda Days and many more.
