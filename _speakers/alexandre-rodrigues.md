<p>After some years using functional programming constructs in imperative languages, Alexandre decided to get a job where he could work full time with a functional programming language. That was when he met Erlang and fell in love with it.<br />
<br />
He&#39;s currently focused on Erlang system&#39;s security and on making Kivra&#39;s Erlang systems more evolvable and scalable.</p>
