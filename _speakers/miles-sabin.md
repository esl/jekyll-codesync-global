<p>Miles has been doing stuff with Scala for more than a decade, currently with Underscore Consulting. He is a co-founder of Typelevel and his best known project, the Scala generic programming library Shapeless, is the weapon of choice wherever boilerplate needs to be scrapped or arities abstracted over.</p>
