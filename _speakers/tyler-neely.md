<p>After years of getting whooped by bugs at scale at various North American infrastructure companies, Tyler moved to Berlin where he spends his days reading papers, finding bugs in complex systems, and building sled - a modern embedded database for the Rust ecosystem. He believes on-call people should sleep as long as they want.</p>
