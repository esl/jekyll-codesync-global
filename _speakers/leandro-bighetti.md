<p>Leandro is originally from Brazil, and has been working as a software developer for the last 7 years, having worked in Investment Banking, Game Development, and currently in the Energy Industry, at Entelios AG. Entelios enables large energy consumers to commercialise their energy usage, and Entelios&#39; load control system is implemented in Erlang and Elixir. Out of work, when Leandro is not tending to his responsibilities as a husband and soon-to-be dad, he&#39;s usually creating screencast tutorials for his YouTube channel which focuses on developers who aren&#39;t familiar with Elixir or even functional programming.</p>
