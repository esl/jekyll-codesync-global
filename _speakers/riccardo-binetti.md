<p>Riccardo didn&#39;t even think about being a backend developer until he fell in love with Elixir. He is an open source enthusiast and he loves being inspired by beautiful codebases. When he&#39;s not coding he&#39;s usually playing music with strange instruments, such as his Game Boy. You can usually find him online with the nickname rbino.<br />
