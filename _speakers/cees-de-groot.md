<p>Cees de Groot is a coder at heart with 30 years of experience in the field. A long journey through the lands of many programming languages made him land at his current resting spot of Elixir country, where he spends most of his time either at work or in the evening toying with Nerves. Born and raised in the Netherlands, he now lives in rural Canada working remotely.</p>
