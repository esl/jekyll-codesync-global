Jay has been programming professionally for over 10 years. A few years ago, he fell in love with Ruby and began developing a deep interest in good software design, appropriate levels of testing, and other programming paradigms. For the first time since falling in love with Ruby, he has discovered another language with the same charm: Elixir.

Jay has worked as a consultant and instructor at Big Nerd Ranch. More recently he joined Stitch Fix to be a part of a larger team working on a product.

When he's not speaking or teaching, he works remotely from (sweet) home in Alabama. Remote is a perfect working situation as it allows him to do what he loves while being close to the people he loves, his beautiful wife and 2 sons.

 He has spoken at a number of conferences, including but not limited to:

- ElixirConf 2016
- RailsConf 2017 (TDD workshop)
- OSCON 2017
- (Other, regional conferences and meetups.)
