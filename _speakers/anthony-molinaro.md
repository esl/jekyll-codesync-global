Anthony Molinaro has been developing large-scale distributed systems since the late 90s in many languages and environments. First at Goto.com, a pioneering company in search advertising, where he helped to develop many of the core serving pieces in Java, C and Perl. After Goto.com changed its name to Overture.com and was acquired by Yahoo!, Anthony spent 5 years working on the content match advertising system written in C. Upon leaving Yahoo! in 2008 he joined a small startup that used Erlang exclusively and extensively. Later in 2009, Anthony was hired by OpenX where he has since introduced Erlang and spearheaded its use across a large portion of OpenXâ€™s Global Digital Revenue Platform.
