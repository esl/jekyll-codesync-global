<p>Software Engineer by heart, Tiago started his career on the front-end side. During the first years he jumped between web and iOS development, until a friend showed him Elixir. Since then, he has slowly been converted to the backend side. Tiago is also the founder of Coletiv, a software development company, that teams up with companies of all sizes to design, develop and launch digital products for iOS, Android and the web. Needless to say that all backend code is written in Elixir/Erlang.</p>
