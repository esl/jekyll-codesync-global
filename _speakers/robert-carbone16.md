<p>Robert Carbone has always had an affinity for keyboards - acoustic &amp; digital. Fluent in music theory, graphic design and armed with a Masters of Accountancy, his passion lies in the valuation of intangibles, more specifically, analyzing &amp; graphically representing them in conceptual frameworks.<br />
<br />
His journey to develop wearable tech led him to Erlang. Once he got deeper into coding, he recognized a need to make the wxErlang Libraries more accessible to the community.<br />
<br />
Robert is currently spearheading the hack of wxErlang&#39;s 230+ modules. His recurring code and tutorial publications can be found on ScriptCulture.com. ScriptCulture was founded to elevate awareness of Erlang code &amp; the art of calligraphy and, ultimately, to introduce both into academic curriculum.<br />
<br />
When he isn&#39;t being an evangelist for Erlang you will find him longboarding around a city, snagging a disc(frisbee) or composing, at a keyboard.</p>
