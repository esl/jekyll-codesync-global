<p>Simon&nbsp;has been working with Erlang since 2012, when he first joined the Swedish company Tail-F. Simon took a short break from Tail-f in 2013 to work at Ericsson, but returned the same year. Since the acquisition of Tail-F by Cisco in 2014, Simon has relocated to California where he now lives, and continues to build applications on top of the Tail-F products using Erlang, Python and C.</p>
