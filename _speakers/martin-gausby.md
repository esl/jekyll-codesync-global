<p>Martin is a long time Elixir developer with a keen interest in implementing network protocols. For the last couple of years he has been working with Erlang and Elixir systems for a living, and during that time spent way too much time tinkering with his Emacs configuration. Besides that he has a horrible taste in music, enjoys coffee, mechanical keyboards, and is a friend of the podcast.</p>
