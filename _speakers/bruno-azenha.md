<p>After being introduced to Elixir by an enthusiastic friend in beautifully sunny Brazil, Bruno never looked back. Now he works as an Elixir Engineer in Hamburg, Germany, focused on sharpening his programming skills, learning more about the Erlang ecosystem and helping to solve the world&#39;s most pressing mobility issues at Wunder Mobility.<br />

He also likes to dance a lot.</p>
