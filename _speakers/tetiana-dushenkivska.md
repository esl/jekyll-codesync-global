In her free time she contributes to open source and working on her own software/hardware projects and likes the idea of mixing hardware and software together. This is why her personal projects include integration of Arduino, bunch sensors with visual output to the browser. This allows her to write fun games and enjoy &quot;testing&quot; them. As a social person, she likes to build social games, which include &quot;testing&quot; with friends. After sipping a little bit of Elixir (programming language, not actual booze) she started to fell in love with it.</p>
