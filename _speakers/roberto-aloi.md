<p>Passionate about Erlang and property-based testing, Roberto has been working with Erlang technologies since 2007. Sicilian by origin, he is now based in Stockholm where he works as a software engineer at Klarna, providing a smooth purchasing experience to 85 million consumers from 205,000 stores in 17 markets.<br />

The original author of tryerlang.org in a world where Docker containers did not exist yet, Roberto is now working on an Erlang Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation in his not-so-copious spare time.</p>
