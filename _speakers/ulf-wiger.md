<p>Ulf Wiger has been using Erlang since 1992, bought the first-ever commercial license in 1993 and has been a full-time Erlang dev since 1996. While at Ericsson, he became something of an Erlang ambassadeur, speaking about the AXD 301 ATM Switch/Media Gateway and about how Erlang works in large industrial projects. After leaving Ericsson, Ulf joined Erlang Solutions as CTO. He then entered the Connected Device market first via the startup Feuerlabs, then as a freelance contractor to Jaguar Land Rover, and Lead Developer of GENIVI&rsquo;s Remote Vehicle Interaction component. Ulf joined the Aeternity Core Team in 2017 and is now busy exploring and developing blockchain technology. In the Open Source arena, Ulf is perhaps best known for components like Gproc, Jobs, and Exometer. In his spare time, Ulf doubles as an opera singer and dabbles in politics.</p>
