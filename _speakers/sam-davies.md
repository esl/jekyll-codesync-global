<p>Sam has been involved in the Elixir community since early 2017 and has been championing it&#39;s use at Nested, leading a growing team of engineers to build a new breed of world-class estate agency software, with Elixir as the secret sauce.</p>

<p>A reformed physicist, Sam started his career as a Ruby consultant. In a previous life, he has worked as a senior Rails consultant helping Factual bring their flagship Geopulse suite up to date with the latest best practices, and co-founded a startup called ProGolfMe, which allows golfers to get online lessons from a qualified coach.</p>

<p>He was drawn to Elixir because of it&#39;s beginner-friendliness and the power of the underlying Erlang VM and now spends his day-to-day working with Elixir and React, and contributing to open source projects such as Elixir core and the Rihanna job queueing library.</p>
