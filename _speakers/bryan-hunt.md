Bryan is a long term internet developer having installed Java in 96 from a magazine provided CD-ROM, and hacking in Perl before the great dot-com crash. For the last few years he has concentrated on BEAM with a particular emphasis on Elixir. His day job is split between coding Elixir and infrastructure such as AWS and Kubernetes.
