<p>Tobias started his Erlang career around 2000 in the HiPE research group in Uppsala University and have been working professionally with Erlang ever since. While working on the HiPE native code compiler, he created the original Dialyzer and focused his research on type inference for dynamically typed programming languages. He then joined Klarna in the early years, before moving on to join Erik &quot;Happi&quot; Stenman in Happi Hacking.</p>

<p>Since September 2017 Happi Hacking has been working in the &aelig;ternity project, focusing on the core components of the &aelig;ternity blockchain, such as state trees, consensus protocol, virtual machines and the Sophia smart contract programming language.</p>
