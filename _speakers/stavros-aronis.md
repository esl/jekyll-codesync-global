<p>Stavros&#39; experience with Erlang started at the deep end of the pool, when he picked Dialyzer, the famously &quot;never wrong&quot;¬ù tool, and made it even smarter, as a master thesis project under the supervision of Kostis Sagonas. He then made Dialyzer faster and parallel, an improvement which has been included in the Erlang/OTP distribution since 2012. Later he got his PhD by re-engineering Concuerror, another tool for Erlang developers, focused on finding concurrency errors in programs and protocols.<br />
<br />
Stavros loves testing and making tools and is now trying to bring all his favorite techniques into industry as an Erlang Solutions consultant and trainer.</p>
