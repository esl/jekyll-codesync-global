Sam is the CEO of the Archain project, a system of permanent information storage. Sam has been building distributed systems with Erlang, from operating systems to web applications, for around 10 years. He is also a PhD candidate at the University of Kent. When not hacking Erlang, Sam can be found climbing mountains and pondering geopolitics!
