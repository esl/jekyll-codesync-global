<p>Erlang has been Piotr&#39;s the first and only love in the professional life for 9 years already. While not implementing new software for Santa&#39;s factory, he usually helps in building various chat systems.</p>

<p>His specialisations are XMPP and mobile communication and he is an experienced member of MongooseIM server team. He enjoys daily standup candies, looting legendary weapons and annoying peer developers with code reviews.</p>
