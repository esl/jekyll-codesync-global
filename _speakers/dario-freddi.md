<p>I started as a Qt/KDE developer many many years ago, and done several other things since then, among which exploring a lot of different technologies and programming languages, speaking at several conferences about the most random topics and contributing to a number of cool Open Source projects. In between all of this, I also founded a company. Currently hooked on Elixir and Kubernetes.</p>
