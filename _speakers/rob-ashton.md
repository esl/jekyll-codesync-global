<p>Rob has spent about a decade of building software commercially in a plethora of languages and technologies as well as leading enterprise teams, engaging in the odd spot of consultancy and travelling around as a jobless wanderer whilst learning all the way along.<br />
<br />
Now he can be found mostly writing Erlang and Purescript, building distributed media delivery systems for a small B2B&nbsp;company in the UK and also helping to develop an ecosystem around Purerl for the masses.</p>
