<p>Martin was the technical lead on one of the largest (by volume) public sector systems in Europe - the UK National Health Service Spine II. The architecture of this was inspired by Erlang, and the Actor Model - and Spine II has maintained 5 nines availability since its go-live in 2014. Spine II is a big user of Riak, and for the past 3 years Martin has worked full-time on developing and maintaining the open-source Riak project - learning to love Erlang and the BEAM in the process.</p>
