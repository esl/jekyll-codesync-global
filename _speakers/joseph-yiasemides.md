<p>While some of us come to Elixir from a different language, Joseph arrived to Go from the other direction, eager to understand the differences and similarities. He wanted to see what the respective communities were about and what motivates their language of choice. Following experience with both Elixir and Go in the banking sector, Joseph is currently working with Pharo at Port Zero GmbH.</p>
