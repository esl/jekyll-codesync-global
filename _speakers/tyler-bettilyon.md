Tyler is an educator, technologist, writer, programmer, and all around curious human. He holds a bachelor’s degree in computer programming and completed his MBA by counter example in San Francisco’s startup scene. Looking out from inside the Bay Area bubble, he realized that the world is not prepared for the future that technology is bringing. He is now focused on technology education, outreach, and policy.
