<p>Ren&eacute; started thirty years ago with GW-BASIC, landed his first job with 17 using VB6 and later paid his first rent in Rubies. He thinks Erlang/BEAM is the most underrated ecosystem in technology.<br />
<br />
In the last twenty years, he has been very fortunate in getting to know every aspect of creating great software products.</p>
