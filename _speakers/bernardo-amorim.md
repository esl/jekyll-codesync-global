<p>Bernardo started playing around with HTML and JS when he was 11. At age 14 learned PHP through WikiBooks so he could make his MU Online private server registration website and with 1 day running the server learned what SQL Injection is the hard way. Since then he has developer a lot of systems and occupied a range of roles, from intern to CTO of a small startup (also known as the solo developer). Currently he is working with Sunshine Cybernetics and learning about dependent typed languages, interaction combinators and lambda calculus while helping building tools for the next generation of developers.</p>
