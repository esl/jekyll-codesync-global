<p>Greg has always had a passion for metrics and monitoring. When he joined Bleacher Report, he had the opportunity to use the Spandex library to collect distributed trace data and visualize it using Datadog APM.<br />
<br />
Since then, he has joined the Spandex project as a core maintainer, with the goal of supporting various vendor-specific back-ends with a vendor-neutral collection API.<br />
<br />
He is also a core maintainer of the Nerves project for building BEAM-based embedded devices.</p>
