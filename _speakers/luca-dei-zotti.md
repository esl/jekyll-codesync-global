<p>Born in 1986, starts playing with computers early thanks to his father. Actually, will probably not understand a thing until high school (ITIS, computer science), then forgets again everything while studying (again, computer science) at University of Udine for the first three years and Padua for the last two. Joins Athonet for the thesis, and remains there trying to remember how to develop software. Still trying.</p>
