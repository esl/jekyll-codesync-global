<p>Sophia is Professor of Programming Languages at Imperial College London. She started her career in research in compilers, and in particular parsers and attribute grammars. But then she was drawn into the beautiful world of programming languages, and what can be expressed naturally and succinctly with the right choice of paradigm. Since then, she has been working on type systems, module systems, ownership types, traits, type-state and session types for oo languages, and concurrency. With her students, they were the first to propose gradual typing and type inference for Javascript. She is passionate about getting to the bottom of things, and formulating the most elegant and precise explanation.</p>
