<p>Carlos Baquero is an Assistant Professor and teaches Distributed Systems at Universidade do Minho, Portugal. He is a&nbsp;Senior Researcher at the High Assurance Software Laboratory within INESC TEC. In the 90s, motivated by mobile computing&nbsp;and offline operation for file systems, he studied data types with merge operations over semi-lattices, a precursor to state-based CRDTs.<br />
<br />
As an academic, he believes on pursuing research that can have a practical impact. His work on causality tracking, scalable&nbsp;bloom filters, and CRDTs made its way into several products and systems, running in production worldwide.</p>

<p>Away from&nbsp;computers he enjoys mountain climbing, and scavenging for old mechanical calculators.<br />
