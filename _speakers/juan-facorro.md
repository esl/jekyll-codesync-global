After working with object-oriented languages for years, Juan entered the functional programming world working on personal projects in Common Lisp and Clojure. That’s when he knew he had found something great. 

While at Inaka he discovered Erlang and coding at work became a joy again. As a Klarna software engineer, he’s been building and improving highly available systems both in Erlang and not-Erlang (although mostly Erlang) and enjoying the beautiful Swedish summers.
<p>Whilst at Inaka (the most awesome company he worked for in Buenos Aires) he&nbsp; startedlearning and building systems in Erlang.</p>

<p>He is now living in Stockholm with his wife, working for Klarna building and maintaining Erlang applications.</p>
