<p>Arif worked in the oil industry and then in Telecoms where he took it upon himself to be an Erlang evangelist. He pushed hard to implement challenging Erlang projects, that were assumed to be non-feasible by others. He is currently employed as a Product Manager in Athonet&#39;s R&amp;D department.</p>
