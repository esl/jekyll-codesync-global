<p>Boyd&rsquo;s near 30-year career spans the range of software projects, from desktop publishing, to web servers, to game consoles, to low-level operating systems. For the past four years, he has been independently exploring and building a full stack for Connected Devices that heavily leverages the BEAM.<br />
<br />
Previously, Boyd spent 18 years at Microsoft running engineering for things such as Xbox Live, XNA (game developer program), and everything OS for Xbox One. This work includes large scaled-out datacenter services, VMs, and the layout of the hypervisor/kernel.<br />
<br />
His most recent release is the open-source Scenic libraries, which is a functional UI stack built on the BEAM. Its primary goal is for use in connected devices, but it is already being used for desktop apps and more. His current work takes the foundation laid with Scenic and is attempting to answer deeper questions about the future of client-side operating systems.</p>
