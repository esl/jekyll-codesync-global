<p>Liesbeth De Mol is a researcher of the French National Research Foundation (CNRS) based in Lille. She studied art history, archaeology and philosophy in Gent and obtained her PhD degree in philosophy in 2007. Her work is driven by the conviction that we are strongly in need of a deeper and independent reflection on computing and programming. In her own work, this is done by developing historical, epistemological and foundational questions that challenge common ways of thinking. She has worked on the history and philosophy of computability; the reciprocal histories between mathematics, computing and engineering as well as the historical and epistemological connections, or lack thereof, between logic and computer science. She got into programming during her PhD research on a specific class of formal devices known as tag systems and which required, at a certain point, a computer-assisted approach. She is an advocate of history and philosophy of computing which does not shy away from technical expertise and practice.<br />
<br />
She has published in a variety of venues which reflects her a-disciplinary stance. She is also the founding president of the DHST/DLMPST commission for the history and philosophy of computing and, currently, also the PI for the <a href="https://programme.hypotheses.org/">ANR research project PROGRAMme</a> on the history and philosophy of computer programs.<br />
