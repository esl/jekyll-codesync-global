<p>Sanne is a former teacher turned software engineer. Currently, she works at TELE2 in Amsterdam, building applications that help her colleagues keep an eye on anything network-related. When she&#39;s not coding, you&#39;ll probably find her either 25 browser tabs deep into a new CS topic, or behind her sewing machine.</p>
