<p>Blindly passionate software engineer/architect since 1997 and an enlightened and happy software engineer/architect since around 2010. That&#39;s when Irina discovered Erlang and the BEAM, its amazing VM, while dealing with an enormous scale distributed web server in online targeted advertising space running on JVM. At that moment, she knew there was a BEAM of light at the end of that tunnel.</p>
