<p>Mikhail spent 8 years processing stock exchange data using core Java and blogging about Java performance ( http://java-performance.info/ ). Yet, when contacted by WhatsApp, he didn&#39;t hesitate and joined WhatsApp server team. Next 2 years he was mastering Erlang performance tuning and had a lot of fun optimizing WhatsApp push notifications system. Nowadays Mikhail is busy building ForgETS - Mnesia replacement for the virtual server environments supporting global replication.</p>
