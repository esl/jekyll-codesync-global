<p>Tjaco, born and raised as a musician, has been hitting drums since he was 3 years old. After many years of explorations in the musical world he discovered a new passion, coding, and has managed to turn this second passion in life into his profession as well. Currently Tjaco works @Kabisa, while still playing drums and vibraphone whenever the opportunity arises.</p>

<p>For the last couple of years Tjaco has been hooked on Elixir and loves to find new and interesting ways to use existing tools making them more useful or just more fun!</p>
