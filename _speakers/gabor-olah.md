<p>Gabor was introduced to&nbsp;Erlang during his university studies by participating in the RefactorErl group. He was interested in language design and a lot of academic problems, so this project was an excellent opportunity to get into type systems and other projects. From there,&nbsp;he&nbsp;joined Ericsson Hungary in 2011 to work on telephony switches (mostly on the famous one mentioned in Joe&rsquo;s book). This taught Gabor to&nbsp;enjoy the complexity of this application.</p>

<p>This was the point when Gabor&nbsp;started loving working with legacy code and learned how to work&nbsp;in a team. After three and a half years, he joined a research project inside Ericsson where he was exposed to Executable UML and testing strategies. In 2015, Gabor joined Erlang Solutions where he has&nbsp;been working with different clients (e.g. backbone financial payment solutions) as well as internal products like WombatOAM. Gabor&#39;s main professional interests are language design, architecture and math.</p>

<p>Gabor&nbsp;likes drawing and painting, watching science fiction movies and series, he is a big Doctor Who fan.</p>
