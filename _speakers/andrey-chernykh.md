<p>Andrey started as C# developer more than 10 years ago, with C# he took the path from junior developer to team lead position. After doing enterprise stuff, Andrey switched to Ruby. Andrey had been working with Ruby on various projects for years when he decided to add new programming language for concurrent, distributed systems into the toolbox.<br />
<br />
He considered Scala, Go, Erlang ... and finally noticed Elixir. Elixir made the same wow-effect as Ruby when Andrey had first switched to it from C#. Andrey had found what he&#39;d been searching for!<br />
<br />
Andrey works with Elixir on a daily basis and has done so for the past two years. Andrey&#39;s created a number of services which work in production, he contributes to open source (exop, express and other), writes articles on Medium and enjoys Elixir every single day. Andrey is very keen on clean, maintainable code and the DDD principle.</p>
