<p>Peter has worked in internet technologies for the last 20 years, from HTML to distributed computing. Wanting to live in Japan but not wanting to work for Japanese companies, he founded a British IT company in Tokyo in 2014 providing bi-lingual enterprise-grade support, project management and software development. He still pines for his beloved Lumia 950xl, but is coming to accept that dead is dead.</p>
