<p>D&aacute;niel fell in love with Erlang a decade ago, working for Ericsson in Budapest. After his project got outsourced to India he tried himself as a consultant. Unfortunately, it turned out that kicking off many projects but hardly ever seeing them finish is not everyone&rsquo;s dream job. So he moved to Stockholm to join Klarna, where he has been happily tweaking a big and old system for scalability and stability ever since.</p>
