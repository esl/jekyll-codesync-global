<p>Anayeli Malvaez is a Senior Backend Developer at Bunsan. For some years, she tried to learn how to code without success until she got to know Elixir. She found her true passion for coding using that language. With the help of the community she met at the Mexico city&#39;s Elixir meetup, she improved her skills and became a programmer.</p>

<p>For the last two years, she has been using Elixir and now she would love to be able to transmit what she has learned.</p>
