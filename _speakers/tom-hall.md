<p>Tom is well known to those that know him well - an occasional mountaineer, part-time cyclist and part-time typer-at-a-computer doing a mix of dev and ops since before DevOps was a thing. At the moment he&#39;s interested in generative art, Elixir and Julia and has been a little bit obsessed with using ideas from functional programming and distributed build systems to make data pipelines and ETL workflows better.</p>
