<p>Jeff is a concurrency and hardware junky from OKC. He arrived at the gates of Erlang as a refugee after spending many years in denial of the realities of concurrency in OOP languages. He began experimenting with Erlang in 2010 and started writing Elixir professionally in 2013. He enjoys collecting STEM-related hobbies and traveling with his wife Laura.</p>
