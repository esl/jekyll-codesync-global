Jesse J. Anderson has been creating things for the web since before comic book movies were cool, first as a designer and more recently as a developer. He prefers ortholinear keyboards, Oxford commas, and spaces over tabs. While known as an Elixir evangelist, he actually gets paid to work as a front end designer at Planning Center. Jesse currently lives near Seattle with his wife and 3 children.
