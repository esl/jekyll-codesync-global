My passion for computer science was born the first time I saw my older brother playing with his “Commodore 16”. I was very young and I didn’t understand the meaning of “insert and remove compact cassettes”, “load”, “return”, etc.. but it was so fascinating and it surely influenced me when, years later, I decided to study computer science. At the moment I mostly create back-end solution, I’m also very interested in distribution and scalability problems of software.
Anyway the software world is not the only one for me: I’m a great basket fan, I love good food (if you want to make me happy bring me to a good restaurant) and long walks in the mountains.
