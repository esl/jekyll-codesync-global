<p>Felienne&nbsp;is assistant professor at Delft University of Technology, in the Software Technology department where she researches programming education for elementary school children. What cognitive skills are needed for programming? What misconceptions can occur when children are learning to program? These are some of the questions that&nbsp;intrigue Felienne.</p>
