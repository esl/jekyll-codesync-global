<p>Peter Alvaro is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of California Santa Cruz, where he leads the <a href="http://disorderlylabs.github.io">Disorderly Labs research group</a>. His research focuses on using data-centric languages and analysis techniques to build and reason about data-intensive distributed systems, in order to make them scalable, predictable and robust to the failures and nondeterminism endemic to large-scale distribution. Peter earned his PhD at UC Berkeley, where he studied with Joseph M. Hellerstein. He is a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award and the Facebook Research Award.</p>
