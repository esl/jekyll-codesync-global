<p>Even before graduating, Fredrik was captured by the beauty of Erlang during his studies at Uppsala University. During his final semester he joined Erlang Solutions part time while finishing his thesis project<br />
<br />
Since then he has worked at companies like Spotify, Netlight, Campanja, Dooer and Klarna where he has worked with some of the larger industry languages such as Javascript and Python. During his spare time, he currently is exploring Rust as a language of choice.<br />
<br />
Fredrik is very fond of tooling that can help him from making silly mistakes if a system can find his mistakes it should.<br />
<br />
Today he is working as a freelancing full-stack consultant and specializes in dealing with legacy systems no matter what language it is written in. The end goal is to develop a product and not have to rely on the consultancy</p>
