<p>Raimo stumbled over Erlang in a course in parallel computing in 1996, and has been in the OTP team at Ericsson since the start of the millennium.<br />
<br />
During that time he has worked on such diverse things as an earlier version of the trace subsystem, the fprof profiling tool, the Emulator Toolbox for Pathologists, the TCP/UDP/SCTP subsystem, the DNS resolver, the erlang.org site and mailing lists, the internal OTP lab and CI toolchain, the rand module, erlang.org/doc/search, and gen_statem.</p>
