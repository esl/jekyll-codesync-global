Code BEAM Lite conferences, formerly known as Erlang Factory Lites, are one-day community-driven conferences aimed at discovering the future of the Erlang Ecosystem and bringing together developers to share knowledge & ideas, learn from each other and inspire to invent the future. These conferences are being organised in various locations across 2018, we already confirmed two in Milan and Berlin!
