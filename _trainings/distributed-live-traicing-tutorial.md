Gabor Olah will show you how to use a unique feature of the Erlang VM: Tracing Erlang and Elixir programs in a distributed network. Tracing allows us to understand a running system from the perspective of the VM. We will discover how to utilise this feature to x-ray everything from a single node to a distributed application. We will discuss how to incorporate tracing into a development workflow as well as safe tracing in production. We also explore other possibilities of debugging of the BEAM. We will demonstrate the techniques for both Erlang and Elixir.

**Expertise: Intermediate**

Target audience: Software Developers & Support Engineers

Duration: 4 hours

Prerequisites: Practical experience of Erlang or Elixir

Objectives:

- Understanding of the low level mechanism of tracing
- Understanding of where tracing fits into the development flow
- Understanding tracing in a single noe
- Understanding tracing in a distributed cluster

**Course Outline**

The course covers the topics of tracing in the BEAM virtual machine. It is applicable for both Erlang and Elixir as most libraries are the same. The course covers the following tracing libraries:

- Built-in tracer
- dbg
- redbug/rexbug

The course gives practical advice for tracing on a live system let it be a single node or a distributed cluster. We will discuss how tracing can complement logging and monitoring.

**ABOUT THE TRAINER**

Gabor was introduced to Erlang during his university studies by participating in the RefactorErl group. He joined Ericsson Hungary in 2011 to work on telephony switches (mostly on the famous one mentioned in Joe Armstrongâ€™s book). This taught Gabor to enjoy complex applications. In 2015, Gabor joined Erlang Solutions where he has been working with different clients in the Fintech space as well as internal products such as the WombatOAM monitoring tool. Gabor's main professional interests are language design, architecture and math.
