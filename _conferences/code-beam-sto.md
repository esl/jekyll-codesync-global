RESCHEDULED TO 10-11 SEPTEMBER DUE TO COVID-19

Code BEAM

STO is the only conference in Europe to bring Erlang, Elixir, and
all of the languages that run on the BEAM together.

Learn from 50+ cutting-edge talks and our in-depth training program,
how BEAM languages are revolutionising areas like IoT, Blockchain,
Fintech, Security, Machine Learning and more.

As of 2018, Code BEAM STO, formerly known as the Erlang User
Conference, joined the Code Sync family of tech conferences.
