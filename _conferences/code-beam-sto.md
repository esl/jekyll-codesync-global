For the health and safety of speakers, attendees and the wider community Code BEAM STO is going VIRTUAL.

Code BEAM V will be the third virtual conference from our team. We've developed a format to ensure our virtual events offer the knowledge sharing, inspiration, networking and community experience you'd expect from any of our events.

Enjoy two days of real-world, practical applications of Erlang, Elixir and the BEAM - all within the context of high-performance and massively-scalable distributed systems.

More information will be available soon. Let's stay connected!
