overview_heading: For the health and safety of speakers, attendees and the wider community
  Code BEAM STO is going VIRTUAL.  Code BEAM V will be the third virtual conference
  from our team. We've developed a format to ensure our virtual events offer the knowledge
  sharing, inspiration, networking and community experience you'd expect from any
  of our events.  Enjoy two days of real-world, practical applications of Erlang,
  Elixir and the BEAM - all within the context of high-performance and massively-scalable
  distributed systems.  More information will be available soon. Let's stay connected!
